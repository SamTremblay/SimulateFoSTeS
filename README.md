# SimulateFoSTeS
Simulate next-generation sequencing data containing template-switching events from a FASTA file

This script generates paired-end FastQ reads using a FASTA file as a reference genome. A specified proportion of the reads will contain randomly generated template-switching events. The script also outputs reference files containing the read positions as well as the template-switch positions.

This script was designed as a way to simulate template-switching rearrangements to use as a benchmark for detection of structural variants from next-generation sequencing data.
